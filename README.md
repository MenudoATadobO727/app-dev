My favorite series
- Maquia
- War of the Worlds
- Cloverfield
# Maquia
***Maquia* is one of the animated / movies that I put in my list because I like how the plot goes in the movie and 
in the end they showed how the plot ends without living any clifhanger thus presenting a 1 whole movie without needing for continuation but living the audience satisfied and sad at the same time.**
# War of the worlds 
**The second one in my list is the movie *War of the Worlds* I remember watching this movie at night and I stayed on my seat the entire time till I finished the movie along with the other people in the room
The plot of the movie plus the sci-fi vibes made an impact for me when I was a child that till I know sci-fi is my go to movies when I want to watch some movies in the side overall I like how the movies shows a well
and peaceful environment and suddenly eerie and post apocalyptic vibes giving more a scary vibes**
# Cloverfield
**Clover field is the last in my list and this is also one of the most good movies that I watch back then I remember watching it at night and enjoyed it till the end cause of the documentary type of movie that I even though it was a real thing that had happened back then..**
